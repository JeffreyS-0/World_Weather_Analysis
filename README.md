# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to my application that has helped me plan my next vacation! Below you will see the steps I took to plan this trip and if it intrigues you, by all means, use it for your next trip too!

## Weather
Arguably, the most important part of a vacation is to have enjoyable weather. This is where we start, as a curious traveler yourself, you will input your desired Minimum and Maximum temperatures that you would like to be in. After doing so, the algorithm will generate hundreds of cities around the world that currently fit within the desired temperature range. The database will actualy go a step further and display a few extra weather metrics in real time like:
  - Cloudiness Percentage (%)
  - Humiditty Percentage (%)
  - Wind Speed (mph)
  - Current Weather Description 

If we take a look at the vacation I have planned for example, we can see the cities that I have chosen and the routes that I could take to get from city to city.

## Vacation Search
To begin, my ideal temperature range is between 65 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. When we input this into the application, the application will find all the cities around the world that fit in that temperature range and will only display cities with hotels close by.

## Vacation Itinerary
I have always wanted to go Japan, so this was the perfect excuse to plan out my next trip overseas! As you can see below, I have chosen 4 cities in Japan to visit and with the help from Google Maps, we were able to plan out the exact route to take as we travel between cities!

I hope this has encouraged you to take off time from work and get out and travel! Because we all know... you need it. :)
